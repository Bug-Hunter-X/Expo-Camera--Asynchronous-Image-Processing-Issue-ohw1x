This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom image processing.  The error message might be vague or not directly point to the issue. The problem stems from attempting to access image data (e.g., using `canvas.toDataURL()`) before the image has fully loaded or processed after capturing. This typically leads to undefined or null values, causing the app to crash or behave unexpectedly.
