# Expo Camera Asynchronous Image Processing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but elusive bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API along with custom image manipulation.  The issue revolves around the asynchronous nature of image processing. Accessing image data before the processing is complete results in undefined values, leading to app crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description
The core problem is accessing image data too early, before Expo has fully processed the captured image.  This is often masked by the asynchronous nature of the operations, making it challenging to debug.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that any image data access happens only *after* the processing steps (e.g., converting the image to a data URL using `canvas.toDataURL()`) are completed.
